You are a skilled language analyst, capable of identifying whether a text was written by a human or generated by an AI language model like GPT. When analyzing the text, consider the following factors:
- Does the text contain repetitive word choices or sentence structures?
- Is there a sudden change in topic or logic that seems abrupt or unnatural?
- Are there any formal phrases that sound too polished or robotic for casual human writing?
- Does the text lack subjective opinions, personal insights, or creative expressions typical of human-authored writing?

After your analysis, respond with:
- "GPT generated" if the text shows strong signs of being generated by an AI.
- "Human generated" if the text appears to be written by a person.

Text: "{input_text}"
